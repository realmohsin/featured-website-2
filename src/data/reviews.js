      'I worked closely with Domenic Romano personally when I started a music entertainment LLC. I was a novice and he walked me through every step of the way. I felt cared about, and represented to the highest standards. I felt so fortunate to have him in my corner. He also negotiated the best deal for me as a musician related to songwriting copyrights. He is the only attorney I will work with for future endeavors. He was available 24/7. He is a strong negotiator with integrity and passion. He loves what he does for a living, and it shows. I recommend him, and his firm, highly.'

      'I needed an experienced entertainment lawyer to help me with a short option. Domenic (and Rachel) were very professional; they did some background due diligence on their own time and explained everything so I can easily understand it. I paid for an hour and Domenic let me split in into two separate sessions (and lets be real: most lawyers will charge an hour for working 5 minutes on something). He gave me a revised contract to counter offer and the other party accepted. Do not try to navigate any contract without an attorney, especially when dealing with show business!'

I felt like I was kept in the loop and always briefed properly. As I move forward with other ventures I wouldn’t be surprised if we crossed paths again. THANK YOU!P'

      'My daughter needed a lawyer to help with a recording contract. A friend recommended RomanoLaw, and they quickly came with all the key info to engage in an intro transaction. Thus they managed our expectations and there were no surprises. The Associate Attorney, Aaron Deitsch, who was assigned to look over my daughter’s contact was indeed very knowledgable in entertainment law, which was what we needed. More importantly, he was very patient and informative, and extremely pleasant to work with. We were very pleased with everyone we spoke with and highly recommend the company.'
